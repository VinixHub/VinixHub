### Hello friend ðŸ‘‹! I'm Facundo.
. Im on my second year inside the 'UTN' (National Technologycal University) doing a grade on Information Systems Engineering.
. Hope my bad english don't bother you! hehe.
. I truly love code webs or POO programs, but in this moment i have to pause this hobby due the university.
. This README is actually in work, so come back soon (or in months hehe) and you will see it finished!

. TODO:
  -> Put a photo of the current state of my grade.
  -> Make a time-line of my dev carrer and what i want to goal.
  -> Improve this README english like i actually know how to write it hehe.
